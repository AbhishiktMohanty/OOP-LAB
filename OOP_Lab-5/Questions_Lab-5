Q1. Create a class distance which stores a distance in feet and inches.
Input 2 distance values in objects, add them, store the resultant distance in and object and display it
                     [Write the program in two ways]
            a. Store the resultant distance in the calling object:C3.add(C1,C2)
            b. Return the resultant object C3=C1.add(C2)

Q2. Create a class with an integer data member. Include functions for input and output in class. Count
the number of times each function is called and display it.

Q3. WAP to count the number of objects in a class.

Q4. WAP to swap two integers using pass by reference.

Q5. WAP to increment the value of an argument given to function.

Q6. WAP which displays a given charecter, n number of times, using a function. When the n value is provided,
it should print the given charecter 80 times. When both the charecter and n value is not provided, it should 
print '*' charecter 80 times.
               [Write the above program in two ways:-
                        - using function overloading.
                        - using default arguments.]
